create data type (natural number)
	with case (zero)
	and  case (succ (natural number)).

define function ($ is zero) from (natural number) to (boolean)
	such that ((zero) is zero) is (true)
	and ((anything else) is zero) is (false).

define function ($ + $)
	from ((natural number) and (natural number)) to (natural number)
	such that ((zero) + $x) is ($x)
	and ((succ $x) + $y) is (succ (add $x $y)).
