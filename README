Calein is a toy programming language I'm working on, and an interpreter for it.
The interpreter is very hacky, and I'm not going to try very hard to fix some
of that hackiness because, once the interpreter implements a sufficiently
expressive language, I plan to do the write-a-compiler-for-the-language-in-
itself-and-use-the-interpreter-to-run-it-on-itself thing.

There are a few examples in the examples directory, all of which work with the
exception of examples/data.cln . That one has some very tentative things that
might not match the ultimate design.

This code doesn't have a license yet. It probably will at some point, though I
don't particularly expect anyone who isn't me to desire to use it.
